# Were RNN all we Needed ?

using the suggested models which outperform the original models like LSTM, GRU and some transformer application , with size and performance.

using min versions of (GRU,LSTM) with the power of parallel , compare it with the original models from Pytorch.

Comparison :

| Model | Original | Minimal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GRU | ![GRU](assets/GRUV.png) | ![minGRU](assets/GRUV2.png) |
| LSTM | ![LSTM](assets/LSTMV.png) | ![minLSTM](assets/LSTMV2.png) |
